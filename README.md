## Implementation of Media Independent Handover (IEEE 802.21) in ns-3 
### Overview:
IEEE 802.21 provides a media-independent framework for seamless handovers between heterogenous networks [1]. There has been a partial implementation of MIH in ns-3 [2]. This has been ported from ns-3.21 to ns-3.26. This repository contains the implementation of MIH in ns-3 [3].
